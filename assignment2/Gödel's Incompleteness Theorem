	\paragraph{ The incompleteness theorems of Gödel are two mathematical logic theorems that deal with the probability limits of formal axiomatic systems. No consistent set of axioms whose theorems can be expressed by an effective process (i.e., an algorithm) can establish all facts about natural number arithmetic, according to the first incompleteness theorem.}
	
	\paragraph{ Completeness, consistency, and effective axiomatization in formal systems - The incompleteness theorems apply to formal systems that are sufficiently complex to explain the basic arithmetic of natural numbers and that are consistent and successfully axiomatized, as described below.Completeness: A set of axioms is (syntactically, or negation-) complete if, for any statement in the axioms' language, that statement or its negation is provable from the axioms.}
	
	\paragraph{In Gödel's 1931 work "On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I," the first incompleteness theorem appeared as "Theorem VI."
	The theorem's unprovable assertion GF is commonly referred to as "the Gödel sentence" for the system F. The proof creates a specific Gödel sentence for the system F, although there are an unlimited number of statements in the system's language that possess the same features, such as the conjunction of the Gödel sentence with any logically acceptable phrase.}
	
	\paragraph{The second incompleteness theorem is based on the fact that there are two types of incomplete It is feasible to canonically define a formula Cons(F) that expresses the consistency of any formal system F that contains fundamental arithmetic. "There does not exist a natural number coding a formal derivation within the system F whose conclusion is a syntactic contradiction," says this formula."}
